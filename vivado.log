WARNING: [Constraints 18-5648] For reconfigurable module design_1_i/axis_ip_top_0/inst, the top/bottom edges of its PBLOCK myDFX are aligned with clock regions. With this type of floorplan, it has limited routability at PBLOCK top/bottom edges due to routing containment requirement. The edge tiles (only listed 10) are CLEM_X38Y119 CLEL_R_X38Y119 CLEM_X39Y119 CLEL_R_X39Y119 CLEL_R_X40Y119 CLEM_X41Y119 CLEM_X42Y119 CLEL_R_X42Y119 CLEM_X43Y119 CLEL_R_X43Y119 : . Tool will infer PROHIBIT on those tiles to enhancement routability at the edges of PBLOCK. You may also make the PBLOCK not aligned to clock region at top/bottom edges as a solution.
